This guide is the first one in a planned series of three. It guides the beginner and intermediate malware analyst in the art of malware analysis, by setting up a basic virtual analysis machine. It is focused on free and open source tools in order to make it available to all. This is a strategic choice on my part as we need to join forces, as many as possible, in the battle against malware and the forces behind it.
