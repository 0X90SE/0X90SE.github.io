Ambition was high, oceans of time available it seemed...Then reality came knocking on the door, as usual and the site became less and less maintained with no new content and so forth. That said it doesn't mean that nothing has happened. It just hasn't been added to the site. I'll try to change that and make the site more alive. Every entry does not have to have hours of work behind them and so forth. And to make life easier, I've changed the framework too.

Things may be a bit shaky the next couple of weeks regarding contents, visual representation, availability or similar.
