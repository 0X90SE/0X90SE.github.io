What 0x90.se is

0x90 is the main initiative by Thomas a.k.a Circle and we are a loosely knit number of ethical security professionals mainly located in Sweden. We are not a fixed group and may vary in number of members depending on interest, time and such. However, a few of us has been around in this area for well over 20 years!

We are trying to focus this site on a wide range of areas, both technical and non-technical security in an attempt to reach as many readers as possible. You could say that this site was born out of frustration, as we feel that the area of information and IT security in large is not being focused upon as it should be. Most individuals and many organizations lack essential knowledge in this area and are oblivious about what is going on out there. If we don't react soon, we will fall further behind, in a world where cyber crime is getting more and more sophisticated and gaining more and more economical muscle.

0x90 Fun Facts

CPU Instruction - 0x90 is the hexadecimal representation for the Intel CPU instruction: NOP - No Operation. Many know of this, however, fewer know that NOP is only the short representation for the assembly instruction: XCHG EAX, EAX which in turn does absolutely nothing.

0x90 as hostname - This is one of my favourites! I've been playing with this one for at least 16-17 years on my computers. If a system has a hostname in the form of a hexadecimal number, for example 0x90 and you try to ping it by its hostname from Windows, you will get quite fun results ;) In the case of 0x90, this hostname resolves to IP address: 0.0.0.144. 0x91 will resolve to 0.0.0.145 and so forth. As you can imagine, this will drive some administrators nuts!
